Hi! This is my project called 'Szopixa 2022'. Thanks for checking it! (You can see how the page looks in 'Screenshots' folder)

Main Idea
	Every year i organise a party called 'Szopixa' and that's why I created this page. It encourages to participate in the party and also gives some needed information.
	Main functionality is a possibility to sign up for a party.

Technologies used
	Pages were build with html and css. Later I wanted to change some data dynamicly and thats why i used ejs instead of html.
	For countown I used JavaScript - getting html and css elements from DOM and changing them based on predefined conditions.
	As for databese I used MySQL - posting data with help of Node.js, and later getting posted data from database and displaying it on page.

Difficulties

	The most difficult part of this project some work with MySQL and Node.js, specificly getting data from databese. This was coused becouse of complexity of the database:
	Databese is created in a way that there are three tables with many to many relationships - this is in order to later extract and analyze data (how many people like this type of food etc.)
	At the end getting the data works with just one very long query, but it gives all the important data that later is used on page with help of ejs.
